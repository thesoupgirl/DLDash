# DLDash
To clone:
git clone https://github.com/thesoupgirl/DLDash.git in Terminal

One cloned navigate to DLDash...ex my path is:  ~/downloads/DLDash/DLDash

In this directory, run the command:  npm i

If that doesn't work...make sure you have npm installed. https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

It'll take a while the first time...so get comfy!

After that, to actually run/deploy the app, run this command:  ng serve -o
